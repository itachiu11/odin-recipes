    <p>A hot tamale pie is a Tex-Mex comfort food casserole, known for its spicy and savory ground beef or other meat filling and its baked cornmeal or cornbread crust. Unlike traditional tamales, which are made individually 
        by wrapping masa dough in corn husks and steaming them, 
        this "pie" is baked as a single dish. </p>
